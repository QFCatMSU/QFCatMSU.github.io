## Install Quarto

You need to install version 1.4, which as of 16, November 2023 is the pre-release version of Quarto.

<https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html>

### Packages needed

## Installation of LaTex on Windows (tinyTeX)

This is only needed if you plan to render a Quarto document in PDF format.  

Install package tinytex (in CRAN)
run: tinytex::install_tinytex()

### Update issue with tinyTex

When rendering a PDF Quarto might prompt you to update tlmgr, which is your LaTeX distribution. You will not be able to render a PDF until the update has occurred but following Quarto's prompts will NOT be successful.  You need to update it manually by running:

tinytex::tlmgr_update()
